# Hungry Husky
A dining hall website made using Python, Selenium, Flask, HTML, and CSS

## Why'd we make this?
Our group made this as a part of the Fall 2021 [Oasis](https://valuable-banjo-220.notion.site/Hungry-Husky-1af34d3dda7d41788dc422dcc8793ebb) Program at Northeastern University. The goal was to create a website that scrapes the current food being served everyday in our three school dining halls and present them in a simpler format than our current schools website for students to quickly see what is being served. 

## What was our motivation?
We knew that we wanted a simple project to introduce us to web development and project management, but we also wanted to help solve a problem within the Northeastern Community. Being freshman we noticed that a lot of our fellow frehsman (including ourselves) were frsutrated with the amount of excess information and pages we needed to scroll through to find what was being served at each of the dining halls on our campus that day. Therefore, we thought that we could scrape only the necessarry informationfrom the dining hall website and provide a better user experience for people trying to look at the different food options to decide where they want to eat today.

## What did we learn?
This was the first time our group worked with libraries such as Selenium and Flask. We also learned a lot about project timelines having to manage this project alongside our school work and other extracurricular commitments. We also learned a lot about Human Computer Interaction Principles and designing good layouts for people to read information. This also allowed us to be introduced to programming in python as well as actually connecting backend code to our frontend.

## Features
* A python program that uses Selenium and scrapes food info from each dining hall for each meal type and creates a JSON file.
* A parser that gets rid of extraneous information that the average user may not want (such as calories and eco friendliness).
* A front end using JINJA that displays information neatly according to the designs we made.
* A feature to sort food types (breakfast lunch dinner) and dining halls to choose what you want to view.
